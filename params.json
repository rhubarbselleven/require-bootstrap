Sourced from Yeoman, and then further adapted to streamline JavaScript modular development.\r\n\r\n## Out of the box\r\n\r\n### Products\r\n* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)\r\n* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org)\r\n* [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com)\r\n* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)\r\n* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)\r\n* [Bower](http://bower.io)\r\n* [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Buildable\r\n* Live reload of edited files (JS, css and html templates)\r\n* Testable\r\n* [Travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org) integration\r\n* [Bamboo](http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/) integration\r\n\r\n## Travis Build Status\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rhubarbselleven/require-bootstrap.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rhubarbselleven/require-bootstrap)\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\nBefore you begin, you'll need:\r\n\r\n* Node => 0.8.0\r\n* npm (for NodeJS magic)\r\n* compass (for sass magic)\r\n* bower (for dependency magic)\r\n* grunt-cli (for building magic)\r\n\r\nInstall npm via your distribution's package manager.\r\n\r\n    # Gentoo\r\n    emerge npm\r\n\r\nCompass is installed as a RubyGem, so as a prerequisite, you need to install Ruby.\r\n\r\n    # install compass once you have ruby installed\r\n    gem update --system\r\n    gem install compass\r\n\r\nGrunt and bower need to be available in the global paths\r\n\r\n    # install grunt and bower\r\n    npm install -g grunt-cli bower\r\n\r\nIf you're using Ubuntu, see [this issue](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/201). As there might be something else called node installed on your system.\r\n\r\nYou now have the base prerequisites installed. To install the project related dependencies, execute the following from the require-bootstrap directory.\r\n\r\n    npm install && bower install\r\n\r\nThis will take some time. Once completed, you're all set to go.\r\n\r\n## Building and Running\r\n\r\ngrunt and bower are now your new best friends. From your project directory, you can execute grunt in the following manner:\r\n\r\n    grunt           # build the application for deployment\r\n    grunt test      # run tests\r\n    grunt server    # preview the application in a live environment\r\n\r\nThere are a few caveats, eg you cannot test when you have the server running. However your tests are available under the test/ URL from the live environment.\r\n\r\nBe sure to use bower to pull in all the different JavaScript libraries you're interested in.\r\n\r\n## Where to from here\r\n\r\nIf you're new to Backbone, Marionette or RequireJS - be sure to check out their documentation. This bootstrap supplies you with some basic\r\nviews to start with, but once you start using other libraries and creating new views you'll need their documentation to support you.\r\n\r\n## Travis-ci Integration\r\n\r\nThe .travis.yml is all set up and ready to go, all you need to do is supply the repository.\r\n\r\n## Atlassian Bamboo Integration\r\n\r\nThis bootstrap is all ready to go.\r\n\r\nYou've got the [mocha bamboo reporter](https://github.com/issacg/mocha-bamboo)\r\n\r\nJust waiting on [this issue](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bamboo-nodejs-plugin/issue/4/rebuild-request) for it to be a clean solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-38963434-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
